TODO LIST:
**********
* The WML metacomments (wmllint: et al) are currently only recognized
    if there's a space in between the directive sign (#). Also need to check
    if the tools actually recognize the metacomment without the space-sandwich,
    and report bugs as necessary.
* Image-path functions (~RC and family) would be nice to have hilighted.
* A companion formula AI syntax hilighter would be nice to have.
* A companion WML map syntax highlighter would be nice to have.
* Exotic WML styles still don't hilight properly
