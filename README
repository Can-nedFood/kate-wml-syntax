WESNOTH MARKUP LANGUAGE HIGHLIGHTING FOR KATE
---------------------------------------------

This is a simple, yet functional, WML highlighting schema intended for use with
Kate, KDE's Advanced Text Editor. Since the editor is actually an embeddable KDE
component ready for use by other KDE applications, this schema will also work
with the read-only KatePart in Konqueror, with KDevelop, KWrite and possibly
others.

It is reported to work on KDE 4.1, but its testing and development has been done
with KDE 3.5.

To install, just copy the file named 'wml.xml' into the following path (create
directories as necessary):

<KDE dir>/share/apps/katepart/syntax

<KDE dir> stands for the path to which KDE has been installed (i.e. /opt/kde3 in
SUSE Linux, or /usr in other distributions), *OR* the user's preferences
directory in their home (i.e. /home/andy/.kde). You can install wml.xml to
either locations; the one you choose determines whether other users in your
workstation will be able to use the WML schema as well.

It should work out of the box when opening standard WML (*.cfg, *.pbl) files. If
it does not, there's one Kate-mainline highlighter known to conflict, and it is
located under Scripts->Quake Script (*.cfg). You may need to change its priority
then.
